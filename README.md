## Overview

Garden Proud is for gardening enthusiasts! Users have their own "gardens" on their profile that they can add plants and flowers to. Plants can be browsed by blooming season and saved with the click of a button on the individual plant's page. Only logged in users can add plants, but even non-members can browse plants and read their descriptions.

## Development

This app was made in Node, Express, MySQL, and Sequelize. For the frontend styling we used Bulma.
